
I am from Ukraine and my native city is Lviv. I live, study and I have so many friends here. As for me, I am pround of the history of Lviv and its historical traditions. Lviv is the capital of Western Ukraine. It is a large industrial and an important business centre of Ukraine. Its narrow old streets and a lot of historic and attractive buildings make it one of the best places in the country. Hundreds of tourists come to Lviv every year. They want to visit such impressive architecture as famous churches and monasteries, among which are the Roman Catholic Cathedral, Uspensky Chrurch, St. Georgeâ€™s Cathedral, Jesuit Church and many others.
