My native city
 I live, study and I have so many friends here. As for me, I am pround of the history of Lviv and its historical traditions. Lviv is the capital of Western Ukraine. It is a large industrial and an important business centre of Ukraine. Its narrow old streets and a lot of historic and attractive buildings make it one of the best places in the country. Hundreds of tourists come to Lviv every year. They want to visit such impressive architecture as famous churches and monasteries, among which are the Roman Catholic Cathedral, Uspensky Chrurch, St. George’s Cathedral, Jesuit Church and many others. 
Lviv has plenty of museums. You can visit first a drug store, magical shop, ancient castle or history museum. You can have a walk in the ancient, busy centre of the city and visit city hall, where you will find the mayor. From the top of this bulding you will see every corner of the city. 
You can feel a relaxed atmosphere in my city and you can have a good rest in the Ivan Franko Park. It is situated opposite Lviv University and stretches towards the Hotel “Dnister”. If you want, you can live in a pleasant residential district and you can always find nice restaurants, cafes, bars and shops in Lviv, depending from your tastes and your pocket money. You can make some pretty good shopping for your relatives and friends from the city. Really, the best place is my own city. There are many beautiful places where people live, near forests, rivers, lakes, seas wonderful beaches nearby or in the middle of some great country side and even in the mountains. By the way, I think that all places are the most beautiful.
